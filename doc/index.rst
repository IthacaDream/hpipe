Welcome to hpipe's documentation!
=================================
The hpipe is a workflow engine for Hadoop streaming jobs. The main purpose of
this project is to simplify mulit-job tasks like click-through-rate prediction
in online advertising systems.

You can use the hpipe to assemble separate streaming jobs into a well-structured
workflow. With built-in failover features, you don't need to handle jobs'
failures and retrails.
